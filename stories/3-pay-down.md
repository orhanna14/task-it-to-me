# 1/ Chore: Pay down some debt

The last two bugs show that even with 100% test coverage, you can have bugs
hiding in plain site. We refactor not because we are artists or perfectionist;
we refactor because it allows us to eliminate bugs and deliver features faster.

This story is about doing a small pass at refactoring driven by a couple
practices:

1. Checkout the coverage and metrics which can be generated by rake tasks.
    * What do you think of the tests?
    * The code is rated a `D`. What do you think is hardest about it?
2. Follow the color in your IDE. What does it tell you about different
   responsibilities and cohesion?
3. What about the shape in your IDE? What does it tell you?

In this initial chore, your goal is not to totally refactor this app, it is to
do the minimum based on your insights so that you would feel comfortable
tackling more complex stories.

In your PR you should talk about why this is the right amount of refactoring to
understand and 'own' the code.
